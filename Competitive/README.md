You need to solve the respective challenges and 
You may use

• C/C++

• JavaScript

• Python

• Java

You need to create a pull with YourName.extension in the respective solutions folder

Ex- If you are solving Problem no 0, your name is abhishek and you are solving it in C++, 

Create a pull in the solutions folder of problem 0 with your solution in a file named Abhishek.cpp



## Question 0: Understand the pattern and write the code accordingly.

    #size 3

    ----c----
    --c-b-c--
    c-b-a-b-c
    --c-b-c--
    ----c----

    #size 5

    --------e--------
    ------e-d-e------
    ----e-d-c-d-e----
    --e-d-c-b-c-d-e--
    e-d-c-b-a-b-c-d-e
    --e-d-c-b-c-d-e--
    ----e-d-c-d-e----
    ------e-d-e------
    --------e--------


## Question 1: Write a function to check if a linked list has a loop.

    * The function accepts start of the linked list.
    * The function returns corresponding boolean value.


## Question 2: Write a function to check if the parentheses in an expression is balanced or not. [Using Stack].

    Input: exp = “[()]{}{[()()]()}”
    Output: Balanced

    Input: exp = “[(])”
    Output: Not Balanced

## Question 3: Write a function which takes n as input and returns the corresponding nth fibonacci number.
    NOTE: You have to use recursion.
          You have to make sure program works even for 100th fibonacci number.

## Question 4: Write a function to find the sum of all the leaf node of a binary tree, you are given root of the tree.
                10
              /    \
            20     30
           /      /  \
          40     50   60

          Result : 40 + 50 + 60 = 150.
